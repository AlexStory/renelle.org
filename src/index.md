<h2 class="text-4xl mb-4">renelle</h2>

Renelle is a function, dynamic scripting language heavily inspired by <span class="text-red">[elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)</span>, <span class="text-red">[fsharp](https://fsharp.org)</span>, and <span class="text-red">[go](https://go.dev)</span>. Its main goal is to be easy and fun to use, and is still in active development.
